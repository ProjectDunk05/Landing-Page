            <p>“Allegri and others say that football is a simple thing? I don't share that. 22 men battling it can't be a simple thing with all the variables. Above all, I don't think those who can speak are only those who win. I believe the result is the last thing. If I lose, it breaks my balls, but the result does not justify everything. I gave my life for football but, if I only stopped at the result, at a penalty scored or missed, I would feel like shit. I want to win with my style. Style is who you are in what you do.”</p>
